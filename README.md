# SAFE-Agentic Use Case Analysis (SAFE-AUCA)

SAFE-AUCA is a community library of **real-world use case analyses** for agentic workflows (MCP-enabled systems and tool-using agents), **mapped to [SAFE‑MCP](https://github.com/safe-agentic-framework/safe-mcp) techniques**.

**[SAFE‑MCP](https://github.com/safe-agentic-framework/safe-mcp)** → catalogs *what can go wrong* (attack/failure techniques)  
**SAFE‑AUCA** → shows *where it happens in reality* (workflow + tools + trust boundaries + autonomy) and turns techniques into **controls + tests**

Quick links:
- [SAFE‑MCP](https://github.com/safe-agentic-framework/safe-mcp) technique catalog
- Contributing: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Use case template: [`templates/use-case-template.md`](templates/use-case-template.md)
- Canonical (machine‑readable) registry: [`use-cases.naics2022.crosswalk.json`](use-cases.naics2022.crosswalk.json)

## Why we do use case analysis

Techniques alone aren’t enough: the *same* technique can be low-risk in one workflow and catastrophic in another.

Each detailed use case analysis connects the dots:

**Workflow + operating mode (manual → HITL → autonomous)**  
→ **Kill-chain / failure analysis** (defender-friendly; no exploit steps)  
→ **[SAFE‑MCP](https://github.com/safe-agentic-framework/safe-mcp) technique IDs**  
→ **Controls, detections, and validation tests**

## Contribute (fast path)

We seed a stable list of `SAFE-UC-XXXX` IDs (like [SAFE‑MCP](https://github.com/safe-agentic-framework/safe-mcp)), then contributors “pick up” an ID and write the detailed analysis.

1) Pick a use case ID below with **Status = Seed**  
2) Create the folder at the linked canonical location and write the README using the template  
3) Update the canonical registry (`use-cases.naics2022.crosswalk.json`) and open a PR

Safety rules (non‑negotiable): **no sensitive info, no exploit instructions, grounded in public evidence** (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

Quick contributor workflow:
- Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) (source of truth).
- Claim/propose work via [Use Case Claim / Proposal](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/use-case-claim.yml).
- Ensure PR check **`Registry and Docs Validation`** passes.
- Get required DSO signoff before merge (details in `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## SAFE Use Case ID ↔ NAICS 2022 crosswalk

**How to read this table**
- **One row per use case** (`SAFE-UC-XXXX` is the primary object).
- **NAICS is a crosswalk/mapping field**, not a parent folder.
- A use case can map to **multiple NAICS codes** (shown in the same row).
- Some NAICS sectors use combined-sector shorthand (e.g., **31–33**, **44–45**, **48–49**).

**Status legend**
- **Seed**: ID reserved + mapping exists; detailed write-up may not exist yet (you can contribute it)
- **Draft**: first detailed write-up exists and can be expanded
- **Published**: reviewed and ready for broad use
